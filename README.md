# World_Population

Successfully Done with the Task 2 as a "Data Science Intern" at "Prodigy Infotech".


Description of the Task : World_Population 

The "World_Population" is a real-time Data Analysis Project.
1. The Python Libraries used for the Project were Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
2. The Dataset consists of Country_name, Country_code, Rank, Population Distribution in various years, Growth Rate, 
   World_population_Percentage.
3. Through Analysis, one detect the Ranking of Country using "sort_values" feature.
4. Also, we have determine the Continent-wise population using "groupby" feature.
5. With the help of Matplotlib, we have track the population graph over the years.
6. From above analysis we have found CHINA leading the table with 17.88% population_percentage followed with India, Indonesia and 
   Pakistan.
7. The Seaborn Library helps in determining the correlation between various data_columns using "heatmap" feature.

   Hence, analysis of above dataset helps in exploring various features of data and also came to know about various insights 
   from the Dataset.
